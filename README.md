# Covid19
This project is about finding covid 19 using Deep learning models. Here i have used Resnext101 as a base model then a few more layers such as linear and sigmoid function. You can look into my code. For Data set you can look into my pdf file. Mainly I have collected data sample from Source1, Source3, Source7 in given pdf.
